## Programmatic Access
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-programmatic-access"></a>

Use the following model IDs and endpoint URLs to access this model programmatically. For more information about the available APIs and endpoints, see [APIs supported](apis.html) and [Endpoints supported](endpoints.html).


| **Endpoint** | **Model ID** | **In-Region endpoint URL** | **Geo inference ID** | **Global inference ID** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| bedrock-mantle | anthropic.claude-mythos-preview | https://bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws | N/A | N/A | 

*For example, if region is us-east-1 (N. Virginia), then the bedrock-mantle endpoint URL will be "https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws".*

## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment (set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field). **Priority** delivers the fastest response times for a price premium (set `"service_tier": "priority"`). **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads (set `"service_tier": "flex"`). **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads; it is set at the account level rather than per request (contact your AWS account team to enable). For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

Availability differs by endpoint.

**Availability using the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint**


| **Region** | **In-Region** | **Geo** | **Global** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| us-east-1 (N. Virginia) | ![supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) |

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-preview-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software.

```
pip install -U "anthropic[bedrock]"
```

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:** Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`
