## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-5-1-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment (set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field). **Priority** delivers the fastest response times for a price premium (set `"service_tier": "priority"`). **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads (set `"service_tier": "flex"`). **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads; it is set at the account level rather than per request (contact your AWS account team to enable). For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-5-1-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

## Data Retention
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-5-1-data-retention"></a>

To use this model, you must opt in to provider data sharing by setting your data retention mode to `provider_data_share` via the Data Retention API. For more information, see [Amazon Bedrock abuse detection](abuse-detection.html).

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-5-1-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas to maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock. The default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota [increase request](quotas-increase.html). For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and see the [limits](/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-anthropic-claude-mythos-5-1-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software depending on the APIs you are using.

------
#### [ Messages API ]

```
pip install -U anthropic aws-bedrock-token-generator
```

------
#### [ Invoke/Converse API ]

```
pip install boto3
```

------

**Step 4 - Set environment variables:** Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

------
#### [ Messages API ]

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

------
#### [ Invoke/Converse API ]

```
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
```

------

**Step 5 - Run your first inference request:** Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`
